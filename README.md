# Stock-Price-Prediction
This Python script utilizes libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and keras, alongside web frameworks like Streamlit, to create a web application for predicting stock prices. 

It fetches historical stock data using Yahoo Finance API, preprocesses it, and splits it into training and testing sets. A pre-trained deep learning model is loaded to predict future stock prices based on the testing data. 

The predictions are then visualized alongside the original prices in interactive graphs within the Streamlit web application interface. 

Overall, the script provides a user-friendly platform for exploring and analyzing stock price predictions.
